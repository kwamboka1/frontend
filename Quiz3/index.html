The Kisii tribe (also known as the Gusii tribe) is a Bantu ethnic group who occupy the Kisii highlands in Nyanza, Western Kenya.

Their home area is sandwiched between the Luo and Luhya tribes. Their highlands are also one of the most densely populated and fertile areas of Kenya. The Kisiis constitute the sixth largest ethnic group, comprising about seven percent of the national population. Kisii, which is their ethnic language, is also traditionally known as Ekegusii. Their closest tribe among the Bantus is the Meru tribe, who have an almost similar language and culture.</p>

Kisii land is very fertile and often wet throughout the year, making it a rich agricultural area. As a result, the Kisii tribe is one of the most economically successful tribes of Kenya, alongside the Kikuyu tribe. Due to high altitudes and a favorable climate, the Kisii tribe has exploited their land by growing cash crops of mainly tea, coffee and pyrethrum.

The Kisii tribe also do a lot of domestic farming and supply their communities and the rest of Kenya with agricultural foodstuffs for local consumption. Traditional foods grown by the Kisii people include maize, millet, sorghum, yams, pumpkins and green vegetables. Bananas are a popular fruit in Kisii land and are often found growing along the constantly flowing riverbeds. As a result of the intensive farming that takes place on the densely populated Kiisi land, very little free land remains. Besides farming, the Kisii tribe also raises livestock on their crowded farmland</p>
